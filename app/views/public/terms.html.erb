    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>, the website of <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>, Inc. (“<%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online services, website, online demos, cloud computing platform, <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> API and any other software or
      services provided on or in connection with the services (collectively the “<%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services”). By accessing or using the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (the “Terms”)
      and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the <a href="/legal/privacy">Company Privacy Policy</a>, whether or not you are a registered user of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and
      others who access the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services.</p>
    <h1>1. Use of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services</h1>
    <p>1.1 You may not use the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services if you are a person barred from receiving the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services under the laws of New Zealand or other countries, including the country in which you are a resident or from which you use the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>
      Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services are not intended for children under 13.</p>
    <p>1.2 You agree that your purchases of <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> or any of its affiliates regarding future
      functionality or features.</p>
    <h1>2. Your Account and Use of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services</h1>
    <p>2.1 You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized
      use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> immediately.</p>
    <p>2.2 Your use of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.</p>
    <p>2.3 You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> in connection with the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, unless you have
      been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).</p>
    <p>2.4 You may use the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services only to develop and run applications on the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> infrastructure. You may not access the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>
      or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services.</p>
    <h1>3. Service Policies and Privacy</h1>
    <p>3.1 You agree to comply with the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Acceptable Use Policy available at <a href="/legal/aup">https://monarchshells.com/legal/aup</a> (the "Acceptable Use Policy") which is incorporated herein by this reference and
      which may be updated from time to time.</p>
    <p>3.2 The <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services shall be subject to the privacy policy for the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services available at <a href="/legal/privacy">https://monarchshells.com/legal/privacy</a>. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>'s
      privacy policies.</p>
    <p>3.3 You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the End Users of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for End Users. If End Users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login
      information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>.</p>
    <h1>4. Fees for Use of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services</h1>
    <p>4.1 Subject to the Terms, some <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services such as online demos are provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources
      and services is available by request via a URL as <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> may provide.</p>
    <p>4.2 For all purchased resources and services, we will either charge your credit card on a monthly basis or collect payment via other methods as agreed to in writing and described in a <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> invoice provided to you. Late payments may bear interest
      at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees that <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> incurs
      in collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>'s
      measurements of your use of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> and only in the form of credit for the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services.
      Nothing in these Terms obligates <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> may be shared by <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> with companies who
      work on <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>'s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> and servicing your account. <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> may also provide information in response to valid
      legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties.
      <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services to you for any late payments.</p>
    <p>4.3 For all recurring purchases, <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> may change its fees and payment policies for the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. In addition,
      changes to the fees or payment policies may be posted on the website (or such other URL <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.</p>
    <p>4.4 You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.</p>
    <h1>5. Content on the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services and Take Down Obligations</h1>
    <p>5.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) to which you may have access as part of, or through your use of, the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>
      Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the "Content." The term Content shall specifically exclude the application that you distribute and run using the
      <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services and any source code written by you to be used with the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services (collectively, "Applications").</p>
    <p>5.2 <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to remove any or all Content from the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services. You agree to immediately take down any Content that violates the Acceptable Use Policy, including pursuant to a take down
      request from <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>. In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> to take down certain Content, <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> reserves the right to directly take down such Content or to disable Applications.</p>
    <p>5.3 In the event that you become aware of any violation of the Acceptable Use Policy by an End User of Applications, you shall immediately terminate such end user's account on your Application. <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> reserves the right to disable Applications
      in response to a violation or suspected violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
    <p>5.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) the Application or any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services and for the consequences
      of your actions (including any loss or damage which <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> may suffer) by doing so.</p>
    <p>5.5 You agree that <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content and other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Service. You further acknowledge that you are solely responsible
      for securing and backing up your Applications and any Content.</p>
    <h1>6. Proprietary Rights</h1>
    <p>6.1 You acknowledge and agree that <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> (or <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>'s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services (whether those
      rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).</p>
    <p>6.2 Except as provided in Section 8, <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content or Applications that you create, submit, post, transmit or display
      on, or through, the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content and the Application (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless
      you have agreed otherwise in writing with <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> has no obligation to do so on your behalf.</p>
    <h1>7. License from <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> and Restrictions</h1>
    <p>7.1 <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> as part of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services as provided to you by <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>.

      permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>, in writing (e.g., through an open source software license); or (b) attempt to disable or circumvent any security mechanisms used by the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>
      Services or any applications running on the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services.</p>
    <p>7.3 Open source software licenses for components of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services released under an open source license constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede these Terms,
      the open source licenses govern your agreement with <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> for the use of the components of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services released under an open source license.</p>
    <p>7.4 <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable license, with no right to sub-license, to display the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> trademarks and/or logos ("Marks") as provided by <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> marketing personnel for the sole
      purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services and solely in accordance with <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>’s then current Trademark Usage Guidelines, (provided together with the Marks by <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> marketing personnel). You agree that all
      goodwill generated through your use of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Marks shall inure to the benefit of <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>.</p>

      disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on
      a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.</p>
    <p>8.3 You agree that <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>, in its sole discretion, may use your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features in presentations, marketing materials, customer lists, financial reports and Web
      site listings (including links to your website) for the purpose of advertising or publicizing your use of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services.</p>

    <h1>16. Changes to the Terms</h1>
    <p>16.1 <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> may make changes to the Terms from time to time. If we change the Terms in any substantive way, we will give you at least seven (7) days notice before the changes take effect, during which period of time you may reject the changes

    <p>17.1 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> and govern your use of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services (but excluding any services which <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace
      any prior agreements between you and <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> in relation to the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services.</p>
    <p>17.2 There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture.</p>
    <p>17.3 If <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> provides you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the English language version of these Terms will control if there is any conflict.</p>
    <p>17.4 You agree that <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services dashboard.

      using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.</p>
    <p>17.5 You agree that if <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>'s
      rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>.</p>
    <p>17.6 <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood

      assets not involving a direct competitor of the other party. A party’s sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in breach of this paragraph shall be, at the non-assigning party’s election, termination of your use of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>
      Services upon written notice to the assigning party.</p><br><br>
