      information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to Monarch Solutions.</p>
    <h1>4. Fees for Use of the Monarch Solutions Services</h1>
    <p>4.1 Subject to the Terms, some Monarch Solutions Services such as online demos are provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources
      and services is available by request in #2ProIntl on freenode (or via a URL as Monarch Solutions may provide).</p>
    <p>4.2 For all purchased resources and services, we will either charge your credit card on a monthly basis or collect payment via other methods as agreed to in writing and described in a Monarch Solutions invoice provided to you. Late payments may bear interest
      at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees that Monarch Solutions incurs
      in collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Monarch Solutions's
      measurements of your use of the Monarch Solutions Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Monarch Solutions and only in the form of credit for the Monarch Solutions Services.
      Nothing in these Terms obligates Monarch Solutions to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Monarch Solutions may be shared by Monarch Solutions with companies who
      work on Monarch Solutions's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Monarch Solutions and servicing your account. Monarch Solutions may also provide information in response to valid
      legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Monarch Solutions shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties.
      Monarch Solutions reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Monarch Solutions Services to you for any late payments.</p>
    <p>4.3 For all recurring purchases, Monarch Solutions may change its fees and payment policies for the Monarch Solutions Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. In addition,
      changes to the fees or payment policies may be posted on the website (or such other URL Monarch Solutions may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.</p>
    <p>4.4 You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Monarch Solutions Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.</p>
