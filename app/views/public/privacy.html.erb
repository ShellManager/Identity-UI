    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to ShellManager, a brand of <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>. (“<%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %>,” “we,” or “us”). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, and your choices about the collection
      and use of your information.</p><br>
    <h1>1. How we collect and use information</h1>
    <p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>
    <p>Information you provide us directly: We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, company name, phone number and e-mail address when you register for a <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> account, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain
      any messages you send through the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality
      of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services.</p>
    <p>Analytics information: We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services. These tools collect information sent by your browser, including the pages
      you visit and other information that assists us in improving the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>
    <p>Cookies information: When you visit the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> help you
      log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services),
      and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to
      the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie
      is being sent. However, some features of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
    <p>Log file information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services. When you use the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server
      logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, domain names, landing
      pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
    <p>Clear gifs/web beacons information: When you use the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in
      HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services.</p>
    <p>Commercial and marketing communications: We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages,
      you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features
      of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services-related e-mails.</p>
    <p>Use of certain service type information we collect about you: We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit
      or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of the <%= ENV['APP_COMPANY_NAME'] %> Services; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and
      demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.</p><br>
